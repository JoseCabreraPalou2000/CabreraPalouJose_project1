# blockquotes

We can make text squares with the following format

>The snippet continues here.
```

>This is a **sinippet with quotes**.
>The snippet continues here.

>This is another **sinippet with quotes**.

# Code

It is very useful to mark a text as code, so if we want to add code without it being executed, we can use the following:

This is \`code\`

This is `code`

\`\`All of this is \`code\`.\`\`

``All of this is `code`.``

# Links
We can add marked links within a text. The format would be the following.


`This is a link as a text [Link](https://github.com/ "the title is optional").`

This is a link as a text [Link](https://github.com/ "the title is optional").


# Images
The format we use to insert images is through links.
Below we can see how the format is, as we can see, we can add comments, but is not necessary.
